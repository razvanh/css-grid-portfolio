                    Medicine Iowa is the science and research magazine aimed at physicians, other health-care professionals, researchers, and educators, with news and feature stories on research programs, educational initiatives, and patient care advances.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    My role in this project was to create an online companion for the printed magazine. I chose Wordpress as the underlying platform and built a custom theme that mimicked the print version.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I built custom functionality to organize the articles into issues and created a few different templates (light/dark) for interior pages.
                </p>
